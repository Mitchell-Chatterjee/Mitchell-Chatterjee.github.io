      - Led the migration from a proprietary orchestration framework to Agno/LangChain, enabling a modular, LLM-based agentic retrieval and summarization system integrated with MCP; deployed on-premises across customer sites with 100+ GPUs.
      - Built a real-time RAG pipeline to embed and retrieve billions of multimodal records (audio, text, image), significantly improving search latency and contextual relevance.
      - Spearheaded development of the company-wide evaluation framework, leveraging DeepEval and A/B testing to rigorously measure KPIs, including relevance, latency, and interaction quality — enabling continuous feature improvement.

#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
