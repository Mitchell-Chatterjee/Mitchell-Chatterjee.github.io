## Project Overview

**Iris** is 4Sight's AI-powered investigative assistant that helps investigators quickly uncover relevant content and patterns across datasets through a natural, conversational interface. As part of JSI's next-generation digital intelligence platform, Iris transforms how law enforcement and intelligence agencies analyze complex investigative data.

## Key Capabilities

### Generative AI for Search & Discovery
- **Natural Language Queries**: Responds to investigative questions in plain English, scanning across disparate data sources
- **Contextual Insights**: Proactively generates context-rich insights, highlighting key entities, locations, and topics for each data item
- **Cross-Dataset Analysis**: Identifies insights and prioritizes information across multiple data types into easily digestible summaries
- **Follow-up Dialogue**: Seamlessly transitions into conversational experience for deeper exploration and tracing connections

### Multi-Modal Processing
- **Language Analytics**: Automatically converts speech to actionable text, streamlines transcription and translation, identifies speakers
- **Vision Analytics**: Analyzes vast image collections to identify objects, faces, and extract text with automated content detection
- **Investigative Assistance**: Uses advanced generative AI large language models to provide comprehensive analysis

## Technical Foundation

### Core Technologies (Aligned with Experience)
- **Transformers & LLMs**: Built on state-of-the-art large language model architectures for natural language understanding
- **Natural Language Processing**: Advanced NLP capabilities for entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and content summarization
- **PyTorch & Machine Learning**: Implemented using modern ML frameworks for scalable AI processing
- **High Performance Computing**: Optimized for real-time processing and analysis of large datasets

### Deployment & Security
- **On-Premises Architecture**: All AI capabilities deployed on-premises with no data sent to third-party systems
- **Secure & Compliant**: Built to meet current and future AI regulations, with granular access controls and complete audit logging
- **No Internet Required**: Fully air-gapped deployment ensuring data sovereignty and security

## Real-World Applications

### Operational Impact
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Automates resource-intensive manual tasks like transcription and translation
- **Accelerated Discovery**: Quickly surfaces operationally relevant intelligence the moment it arises
- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Provides investigators with immediate understanding of data significance and context
- **Global Deployment**: Active across 40+ countries supporting critical law enforcement investigations

## Technical Alignment

This project leverages key technical strengths from my experience including:
- **Transformers & LLMs** for conversational AI interfaces
- **Natural Language Processing** for multi-language content analysis  
- **High Performance Computing** for real-time processing at scale
- **PyTorch** and modern ML frameworks for model deployment
