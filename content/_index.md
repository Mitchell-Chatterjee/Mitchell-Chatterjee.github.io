        I'm a Machine Learning Engineer who bridges foundational model research and production ML engineering. My Master's research applied state-of-the-art NLP techniques to medical datasets, and in industry I design and deploy robust LLM-driven retrieval and agent systems, build scalable data pipelines, and implement production model serving and evaluation frameworks.

        I enjoy collaboration across research and engineering â€” if you're working on applied ML, model infrastructure, or evaluation at scale, let's talk.
