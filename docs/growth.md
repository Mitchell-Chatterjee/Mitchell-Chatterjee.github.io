# Growth & UI redesign notes

Quick plan to improve UI, SEO, and reach.

## UI / Design

- Update hero section with short headline + 1-line value prop and CTA (Contact / Download CV).
- Add featured project carousel (RAG system, ECG paper) with 1-2 screenshots.
- Use a single accent color and increase heading contrast; ensure mobile-friendly spacing.

## SEO & Analytics

- Set `baseURL` (done) and update `marketing.seo.description` (done).
- Add Google Analytics / Plausible ID in `config/_default/params.yaml`.
- Add OpenGraph images for key pages (assets/media/).
- Register site with Google Search Console and submit sitemap.

## Content & Outreach

- Publish two long-form case studies: RAG migration and ECG project (done / in progress).
- Share posts on LinkedIn and relevant subreddits (r/MachineLearning, r/MLSys) and Hacker News for big milestones.
- Add RSS-driven newsletters or use GitHub Releases to announce new posts.

## CI / Deployment

- Add GitHub Actions for build (added `.github/workflows/hugo-build.yml`).
- Deploy to Netlify or GitHub Pages; prefer Netlify for easy previews and redirects.

## Next steps

1. Add OG images and screenshots for projects.
2. Add Analytics ID and enable verification.
3. Polish case studies with diagrams and code snippets.
4. Create and publish an announcement post and share across social networks.
